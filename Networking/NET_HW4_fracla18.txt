R19)    Is it possible for Web/Mail servers to have the same Alias for the same host?
        What would be the type for the RR that contains the host name of 
        the mail server?

        a)  Yes, an Alias can point to multiple servers
        b)  The RR type is Alias.


R21)    Will Bob return the favor?  Why/Why not?

        He should.  If he doesn't he won't get as fast of download speeds as if 
        did.  Torrenting gives highest priority to those who seed (the Alice's) so
        it is in Bob's best interest to do so. 

R24)    Advantages/Disadvantages of:
            Total Knowledge DHTs &
            Circular DHTs

            a)  The advantages of tracking every peer is that - transmition
                time is always reduced to it's smallest possible distance.
                i.e. getting to communicate directly (without intermediaries).
            
                The disadvantage being that - each peer has to store far more
                information than in Circular DHTs as well as the addition of an
                internal searching/matching function. 
            
            b)  Circular DHTs are the "linked list" version of peer tracking.
                They are the simplest (or rather the most memory light) way you 
                can keep track of peers.
            
                The disadvantage would be is that do to their memory light
                configuration they are the least time effecient way to track peers. 
                (which is why you want shortcuts)
