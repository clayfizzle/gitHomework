we are the group who couldn't change the permissions on our .ssh files in the first VM.

we couldn't "cd" into the .ssh directory in the first VM (CH) or change permissions on any of the enclosed files.

Stephen confirmed he also encountered the same problem.


EDIT!!!!
Turns out we did get it to work towards the last 45min of class

1) 	fastest scan = nmap -Ps <host path>

	time = 1.33sec

2) 	quietest scan = nmap -sM <host path>

	Urial Maimon scan, super stealthy

3)	Host:  tcp 22,( 25???? )

	Ports unknown: 	64623
					64680
					65000
					65129
					65389
		 
	Services: 	22 = ssh,
				25 = smtp,
				rest = unknown

END EDIT!!!


ONTO complaints::


So the initial problem was with the fact that the "directions" were just a message tag
on the login screen of the EC2 website.  There were no "actual" directions tab or any indecator in the lab 7 handout that showed us where we might find this info.

Then we ran into problems with the permmissions of our user.  i.e. the chmod command
wouldn't work.  
Stephen had to fix our permissions on the back end before we could complete the lab.

Additionally the size of the groups made the lab unweildy and hard to organize.  It was a lot of people to have crowded around one box.

This caused one or two people to do the majority of work while the rest of the group talked about... whatever.
