Prob: R21, R22, R27, P25, P31, P32



R21)    Emission/Transmission rate, Max/Min.
        Given those rates: traffic intensity.
        How long until packet loss.
        Perform twice and compare values.

        a)  Max = 500, Min = 350
        b)  Intensirty = High
        c)  Packet loss occurs when the queue is full and the reciever is still
            recieving packets from the sender.  Speeds will be different for
            sized different packets.  So queue-filling maxes out with bit-rate

R22)    5 Tasks a layer can perform.
        Can more than one task be performed on more than one level.
        
        a)
