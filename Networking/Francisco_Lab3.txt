Lab 3


I must apologize for turning this lab in so late.  

It is partially do to the fact that I couldn't get this lab to work. 
I did observe Duncan get it to work on a single lab computer attacking itself.

After discussing it with Duncan and having him explain the "what's and why's" of
how he got the exercise to work it became apparent that it was my unfamiliarity with the internal structure of socket/port architechture.

Once he got the machines communicating, Wireshark gave fairly clear readouts of the Slowloris Get-request-stall.

The lab machine Duncan got the exercise to work on was Kalex's/Zach's so all the Wireshark documentation is in the report.

This lab made it very apparent I need a greater understanding of the information flow of socket/port architechture. 

Maybe the exploration we are doing of the OS 161 will help.
