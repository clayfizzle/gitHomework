Networking Homework 1

Problems: 
R1, R4, R11, R13, R14, R18, R19, P4-P6, P10-P13

R1) 	Link Layers and circuit swithces.

R4)		Coaxial, Ethernet, Fiberoptic

R11)	Total transmission delay: (L/R1)+(L/R2)

R13)	a) Only 1 at a time.  Or 5 if each user only uses 20% than .20 x 5 = 1Mbps

		b) The link can support 2mbps, each user only uses 1Mbps so 2 users can be supported.

		c) If each user only transmits 20% of the time than that is their probability. 
		   --> .20 OR 20% 

		d) 3 users = 60% chance that 1 user is using at any given time.
		   Probability of all 3 = .20 x .20 x .20 = .008 = .8% 

R14)	Because traffic is so high the fees they would charge eahc other would end up being a wash, creating 
		excess workloads. 

		If they avoid paying a provider ISP the two ISPs can create a direct connection with each other. 
		The IXPs can create a "network" of laterally connected ISPs and charge each ISP to be part of the 
		"network".

R18)	Packet length = 1000 bytes
		Link Dist 	  = 2,500 km 
		Total delay   = 2.5 x 10^8 m/s
		Trans time 	  = 8 Mbps / 2 Mbps
		PropDelay     = d/s + L/R


R19)	a) Max Throughput = 500 kbits OR 500,000 bits/sec
		
		b) 4,000,000 bytes / 500kbits =  ~ 62sec ?
					
		c) It would take 1,000 (or 1024) times longer than the previous example because the throughput is
		   1/1000 th of the previous example.

P4)		a)	16
		b)	4
		c)  sure, but A<->C won't see B<->D and vice-versa.
		
P5)		L = 160,000
		TimeDivided = 12 slots
		bitRate = 1.536 Mbps
		ConnectX = .6 sec
	
		It will take 12 times longer than if it were a non-divided base-band signal. Or than if it had a 
		constant connection.  The tyime-division cuts the users available bandwidth by 12.

P6)		a)	d_Prop 	  = m/s
		b)	transTime = L/R
		c)	m/s + L/R
		d)	Still needs to be processed because of d_Prop.
		e)	Still being propogated.
		f)	on it's way to Host B
		g)	d_Prop  = m/s
			d_Trans = L/R
			
			(m/2.5 x 10^8) = (120 bits / 56 kbps) = 

		     m = (120 bits / (56 kbits/s)) x (2.5x10^8)

			"this doesn't make sense; this packet would take like days to send.  I think I'm doing this wrong"
		
P10)	Dist 	  = Di
		PropSpeed = Si
		TransRate = Ri
				i = 1, 2, 3
				and L;

		3(d_Prop) + 3(S)

P11) 	3S, (just subtract the propagation delay)

P12)  Can't find queing delay.
