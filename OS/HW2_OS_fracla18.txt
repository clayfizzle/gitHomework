Q) 2.1
    
    t  = time
    n  = periods per job
    j  = number of jobs to do    

    ta = n * t
    th = j/ ((j/2 * n * t) * (.5 * n * t))
    
    pu = % of time PROCESSOR is active

    a) 1 job
        
        Turn around    = n * t
        Throughput     = 1 / (.5 * n) + (.5 * n) 
        Processor Util = .5 * n * t
    
    b) 2 job
        
        Turn around    = n * t
        Throughput     = 2 / n + (.5 * n * t)
        Processor Util = active / total time = 
    
    c) 4 job
            
        Turn around    = n * t
        Throughput     = 4 / ((4/2 * n * t) + (.5 * n * t))
        Processor Util = 4/2 + .5 * n * t


Q) 2.2

    IO-bound        = spends more time waiting for IO than using the Processor
    Processor-bound = spends more time using the Processor than waiting for IO

    If the algorithm favors processes that take up small amounts of processing power 
    it should complete the "short" processes first and then move to the more computationally
    intensive processes.  
    Additionally it would be almost impossible to generate enough IO processes to 
    override all the Processor-bound processes.

Q) 2.3

    Multi-Programming VS Time-Sharing

    Time-sharing implies multiple users where multi-programming does not.  
    Therefore time-sharing policies must be much more conserned with even allocation of CPU
    resources.  Multi-programmingpolicies will be more conserned with optimazing CPU performance, 
    oftentimes at the expence of an individual process like IO-bound processes.  
    Time-sharing can't be as flexible with resource allocation because it each user must recieve
    their allocated time-shre regardless of whether they may use it or not.

Q) 2.4
    
    System calls allow the OS to request operations only performable by the kernel.  
    Without system calls we would be able to read or write from memory etc...
    
    User-mode is when is the OS is performing user-requested operations i.e. running applications
    like browsers and games.

    Kernel-mode is when the OS asks the kernel to perform read-write and IO operations that are 
    hardware dependent.
